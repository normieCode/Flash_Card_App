# Flash_Card_App (Spanish)
Flash Card App built in Python

This flash card app is based on the first chapter of the book Aventuras Sixth Edition, which is and/or was a 
Spanish 1 college course book. The video lecture explains the card’s content.

There are four named folders with different .csv files, all with matching Spanish.csv names. Just delete the 
current Spanish.csv and copy the one you want to learn into the flash_card_app folder. This is so you don’t 
have to change the names in the app, you simply copy the one you want to learn and delete the current file, 
then paste it into the main folder. Chapter one is the default Spanish.csv currently highlighted.

I was looking for a simple flash card app on github but kept finding the same broken copies, so me and 
chatgipity fixed one and changed the code to the way I wanted it. The “Next” button moves to the next card, 
the “Flip” button flips to the English side and back to the Spanish side as many times as you want. 
“Random Off” follows the same order as the lecture video. “Random On” creates a random list and iterates 
through each card once and at the end it resets and creates a new random list. If you want to edit out the 
ones you know simply edit the current Spanish.csv and delete it when you’re done and keep the original files 
in their folders to copy again and again or make a new folder. If you mess it up just come back here and 
recopy everything, no worries. Let me know if you need any help or find any errors, I am learning so I will 
gladly help or fix any issues. Also I don’t know Spanish the content is based off the book for the sake of 
studying and currently has no special characters.
