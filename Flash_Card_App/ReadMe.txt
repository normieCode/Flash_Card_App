This flash card app is based on the first chapter of the book Aventuras Sixth Edition, 
which is and/or was a Spanish 1 college course book. The video lecture explans the content.

There are four folders with different .csv files, all with matching Learn.csv names, but they are 
different. Just delete the current Learn.csv and copy the one you want to learn into the flash_card_app 
folder. This is so you donâ€™t have to change the names in the app, you simply copy the one you want 
to learn and delete the current file. Chapter one is the default Learn.csv.

It is currently based on Spanish but you can copy any comma seperated list into the Learn.csv file and line one will populate the header of each card.
