There are four folders with different .csv files, all with matching Spanish.csv names, but they are 
different. Just delete the current Spanish.csv and copy the one you want to learn into the flash_card_app 
folder. This is so you donâ€™t have to change the names in the app, you simply copy the one you want 
to learn and delete the current file. Chapter one is the default Spanish.csv.
